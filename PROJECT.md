Problem:

You are a secret agent attempting to calculate best positioning of satellites to survey the planet in its entirety with the most efficiency.

Restrictions:

However,  He only has access to 2-8 satellites and must position them accurately to survey the most possible land around sperical earth.

Approach:

We began by using a service called GIT, which easily combines the coding of each individiual member into one master code. We created a master .cpp file titled worldwatcher which contained the master code for the window and multiple attatchments for the game. The FLTK files were modified slightly in order to accomidate certain aspects such as attatching a button over an image and PNG support.

Sample Run:

Results and Analysis:

The project was successful. All basic aspects of the project were covered as well as the extra items. The high scores menu contains the top 5 scores, the game works in all difficutlties and the spehrical coordinates/wraparound are incredibly accurate. The game clock properly concatinates to the difficulty level and the score multiplier is also on point.

Conclusion:

This program shows that the FLTK/GUI aspects of C++ are capable of creating and running a simple game. We learned multiple C++ tactics such as subclassing, attatching objects and basic GUI controls. As an introductory course to C++, this project was a good test of the power of C++ while learning the foundations of programming.

Instructions:

Complile the code using the makefile included in the CD/folder and run using ./a.out. All instructions on how to work the game itself are included in the "How to play" section.
